summary: The Apache Groovy programming language
description: |
  This package is intended to bundle the latest version of Apache
  Groovy in the 2.5.x stream of releases.

  Groovy is like a super version of Java:
  * It supports most Java syntax but allows simpler syntax for many constructs
  * It supports all Java libraries but provides many extensions and its own productivity libraries
  * It has both a static and dynamic nature
  * It has great extensibility for the language and tooling

  It is free and open source and has a large community of users and developers
  around the world.

  It requires Java 7 or later Java Development Kit installed.
